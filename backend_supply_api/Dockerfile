# Install uv (optional but good for consistency given the prompt asked for it, 
# although in docker we might just pip install from requirements generated by uv, 
# or use uv directly. I'll use pip for simplicity if uv isn't strictly required in the image,
# BUT the user asked to "Use python package uv...". I'll try to use it to install deps.)

# Copy project definition
COPY pyproject.toml .

# Install dependencies using pip (standard for now as uv in docker needs setup)
# Or I can install uv. Let's stick to standard pip for the Dockerfile to ensure stability unless I know uv is available.
# Actually, I can use uv to generate requirements.txt locally or just install libs.
# Let's install uv in the container.
RUN pip install uv

# Install dependencies
RUN uv pip install --system fastapi uvicorn pydantic
